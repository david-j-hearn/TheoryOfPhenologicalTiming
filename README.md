This repository contains R scripts to generate figures associated with the theory of phenological timing manuscript. 

These files are provided for peer reviewers.

Note to manuscript reviewers: Files contained in the subdirectories of this repository provide all scripts and data necessary to generate all the figures and carry out all the simulations and analyses reported in the manuscript.

Be sure to download all files in the TheoryOfPhenologicalTiming repository and maintain directory structure. Many of the scripts rely on this directory structure.

Unarchive the Data and MCMC trace files before running scripts, as the scripts depend on the unarchived files.
