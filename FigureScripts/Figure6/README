Run 'sh ./makeFigures.sh' to create figure 6. Note that the pipeline is the same to make Figure 3, but the parameters for the simulation are set to different values. Note, also, that Figure 6 is intended to create a poor inference. In the particular run, the maximum likelihood procedure failed to find good parameter values to start the MCMC. The Podophyllum.Cleaned.ForTracer.txt and screenOutput.Podophyllum.txt files provide the output of the specific run using to make the Fig. 6 in the manuscript, and the file Figure6.97_191_1_16.pdf is the figure based on these output files.
